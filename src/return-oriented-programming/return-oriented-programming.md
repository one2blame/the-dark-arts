In this section, you'll find my notes on return oriented programming (ROP) and
how to leverage the technique for exploit development. This section includes
discussions on the following topics:

* Using ROP/JOP to overcome ASLR/NX
* Finding gadgets
* Calling libc functions / syscalls
* Chaining gadgets to execute code
* Using ROP/JOP to execute arbitrary shellcode
