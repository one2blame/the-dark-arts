# Exploit primitives

In this section, you'll find my notes on common exploit primitives and how to
implement them with different vulnerabilities. This section includes discussions
on the following topics:

* Arbitrary write primitives
* Relative write primitives
* Arbitrary read primitives
* Chaining primitives to build an exploit
* Using write primitives to escalate privileges
